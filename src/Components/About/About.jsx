        I graduated from Generation Thailand Junior Software Developer#5 Bootcamp and earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <a href="#">Silpakorn University</a>. These educations provided me with a robust foundation to write
        functional code for both frontend and backend.
        <br />
        I'm open to job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and experience then don't hesitate to contact me.
